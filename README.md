# musicHalt
MusicHalt is a website that helps users to find songs by typing the name of the song, artist, or album.

The project uses iTunes Search API to display to the user a broad list of matching songs based on what they type into the search bar. The application provides a 30-second sample for each song, allowing users to listen to a wide range of song samples from the artist or album they searched for.

This was my final project for a web development bootcamp by Chris Dixon. And It is made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
